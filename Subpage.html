                            <p id="h" >HTML: HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively <strong>easy to learn</strong>, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite <strong>powerful</strong> in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/" title="The World Wide Web Consortium, who oversee everything HTML-related">&raquo; W3C</a>, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language.</p>

                            <p>The definition of HTML is <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>.</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <em>HyperText</em> is the method by which you move around on the web &#8212; by clicking on special text called <strong>hyperlinks</strong> which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is <em>hyper</em> just means it is not linear &#8212; i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links &#8212; there is no set order to do things in.</li>
                                <li><em>Markup</em> is what <strong>HTML tags</strong> do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (<em>italicised</em> text, for example).</li>
                                <li>HTML is a <em>Language</em>, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                        </td>
                    <td style="width: 450px;">
                            <p id="c" > CSS:In the late &#8216;90s, HTML coders noticed that they were retyping the same old tags again and again on the same page, leading to bigger HTML files and above all, time consumption and frustration. You may have found yourself in the same situation, adding in mountains of <a href="../text/font.html" class="more" title="Dirty. Don&#8217;t use &#8217;em">&lt;font&gt;</a> tags, despite wanting them all  the same; or using tricks like <a href="../images/singlepixelimages.html" class="more">invisible gifs</a> for spacing.</p>
                            
                            <p>Then, someone had a great idea: have <strong>one file</strong> that defines all the values that those piles of tags would have done, and then have all your pages checking this file and formatting your pages accordingly. You can therefore leave out most of the formatting tags in HTML and use only nice <a href="../accessibility/logicalstyle.html">structural elements</a> (like headings, paragraphs and links) &#8212; <strong>separating structure and presentation</strong>.</p>
                            
                            <p>In late 1996 CSS (Cascading StyleSheets) became a reality, forged by our good friends the <a href="http://www.w3.org/" title="Get to know the W3C a little better...">&raquo; World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C). Your stylesheet acts as a partner to your HTML code; taking care of all the layout, fonts, colours and overall <em>look</em> of your site.</p>
                            
                            <p>If you ever decide to change the look of your site, you modify that one CSS file (your <em>style sheet</em>) and <strong>all the HTML pages reading from that file will display differently</strong>. This makes maintenance of your design <em>much</em> easier.</p>
                        </td>
                    <td  style="width: 450px;">
                            <p id="c2">CSC 205: <strong>JavaScript is a simple scripting language</strong> invented specifically for use in web browsers <strong>to make websites more dynamic</strong>. On its own, HTML is capable of outputting more-or-less static pages. Once you load them up your view doesn't change much until you click a link to go to a new page. Adding JavaScript to your code allows you to change how the document looks completely, from changing text, to changing colours, to changing the options available in a drop-down list (and much, much more!).</p>

                            <p>JavaScript is a <em>client-side</em> language, which means all the action occurs on the client's (reader's) side of things. This means that no trips to the <a href="../cgi/basicperl.html" title="As happens with CGI Scripts">server</a> are required for JavaScripts to kick into operation, which would slow down the process enormously. JavaScript operations are usually performed instantaneously. In fact, JavaScript is often used to perform operations that would otherwise encumber the server, like <a href="formvalidation.html" title="We&#8217;ll get to this in a few tutorial&#8217;s time. It&#8217;s a great script.">form input validation</a>. This distribution of work to the relatively quick client-side service speeds up the process.</p>
                            <p>JavaScripts are integrated into the browsing environment, which means they can get information about the browser and HTML page, and modify this information, thus changing how things are presented on your screen. This access to information gives JavaScript great power to modify the browsing experience. They can also react to <em>events</em>, such as when the user clicks their mouse, or points to a certain page element. This is also a very powerful ability.</p>
